      "Feed 11: Tighter bank credit means business for money lenders \n",
      "\n",
      "The Hong Kong banking regulator’s move to dampen developers from providing generous mortgage schemes has created new business opportunities for non-banking institutions and money lenders.\n",
      "Ego Finance, one of the major finance companies in Hong Kong, said the new measures would generate more business opportunities for money lenders. With nearly 2,000 new units to come on stream for pre-sale, there is without doubt, a demand for loans.\n",
      "“Home seekers still need to source financing when they come to buy properties,” said chief executive Victor Wong. But he believes only the small mainland developers who rely more on bank lending to finance developments and land acquisitions in Hong Kong, would be affected.\n",
      "“It is still too early to access the impact,” he added.\n",
      "Nevertheless, the firm saw a strong demand for home loan as its mortgage lending business posted a 30 per cent year-on-year growth in the first quarter.\n",
      "Hong Kong homebuyers turn to finance companies as banks tighten mortgage lending\n",
      "The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on May 12 ordered all banks to tighten their property lending to developers to guard lenders from risks from June 1.\n",
      "Under the new measures, the maximum limit allowed on bank loans to buy a plot of land will be cut to 40 per cent of the value of the site, down from the current 50 per cent. The cap on loans for construction costs will drop to 80 per cent from the current level of 100 per cent. And the overall cap on bank financing for the whole project will be reduced to 50 per cent of the expected value of the completed properties, down from 60 per cent.\n",
      "The HKMA hopes that by cutting the amount of financing available to the homebuilder, it will discourage the developers from offering generous mortgages to buyers.\n",
      "Hong Kong homebuilders to face tougher limits on bank borrowing\n",
      "Wong said his firm is focused on buyers purchasing mass homes, which cost HK$4 to HK$7 million.\n",
      "Together with the bank’s first mortgage, he said the firm would not extend loans to applicants who ask for more than 80 per cent of the flat’s value.\n",
      "As most buyers would have secured 50 per cent loan-to-value ratio from banks or developers, he said Ego Finance would offer the 30 per cent on top of the first mortgage.\n",
      "Interest rates would be 10 per cent to 12 per cent per year, compared standard bank charge of 2.2 per cent, he said.\n",
      "He expects the market to be a promising one as more new flats become available for pre-sale.\n",
      "Upcoming projects that would put on sale in the coming weeks include 970-unit Ocean Pride in Tsuen Wan by Cheung Kong Property (Holdings), and K&K Property’s 822-unit Victoria Skye in Kai Tak area.\n",
      "Buyers are tapping financing alternatives as standard bank loans are capped at 60 per cent of the value of homes below HK$10 million, and 50 per cent for homes above HK$10 million.\n",
      "Feed 12: Opinion: Nano flats spur demand for self-storage facilities \n",
      "\n",
      "The growing number of “nano flats”, flats with a usable size area under 160 sq ft, is spurring demand for self-storage facilities. However, storage operators have flagged a 30 per cent drop in available space for business in light of tightening warehouse regulations following a fatal fire in June 2016. These new guidelines have created murky waters for self-storage business owners and landlords. While safety is a priority, CBRE urges the government and operators to find a middle ground so that the market demand is not ignored.\n",
      "There are over 800 self-storage locations managed by about 100 operators across town, according to data from the Fire Department. The Fire Department and the Buildings Department sent warning letters to more than one-third of these operators after a fatal fire took place in a warehouse in Kowloon Bay last year. The letters specified new rules for the fit-out of self-storage warehouses.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two most controversial points amongst the new regulations were the requirement for a 2.4-metre corridor between containers, a 1.4 times increase from the existing regulations on warehouses, and a 1:16 window to total floor area ratio.\n",
      "Based on the new guidelines, about one-third of Hong Kong’s available storage space will be slashed, according to Luigi La Tona, executive director of the Self Storage Association Asia. CBRE predicts that the actual reduction would be more than that as small to medium-sized operators that cannot afford the costs associated with refitting their space will be forced to close down. There have already been various cases of self storage businesses folding. The costs incurred by operators to meet these new regulations will also potentially create a surge in storage rental fees.\n",
      "There have already been various cases of self storage businesses folding. The costs incurred by operators to meet these new regulations will also potentially create a surge in storage rental fees\n",
      "Our team at CBRE believe that there are viable solutions that can satisfy the operator and government’s requirements. For example, container doors could be converted into sliding doors so that the corridor space will not be compromised while both doors are open. From our understanding, the Fire Department has increased the corridor dimension from 1 meter to 2.4 meters to create more space for firemen to move between containers in case of an emergency. A sliding door ensures that the firemen’s safety is taken into account without infringing on the self-storage space.\n",
      "Regarding the 1:16 window to total floor area ratio, CBRE urges the government to reconsider the stipulation. The ratio is a regulatory requirement applicable to office and residential buildings for the sake of airflow and hygiene. CBRE does not believe that this ratio is necessary or suitable for the purposes of a warehouse. Since the foot traffic of warehouses is much lower than that of an office or residential building, we suggest the government reconsider this overarching requirement and judge each storage company on a case-by-case basis.\n",
      "Due to the unclear implementation of the new guidelines, landlords of warehouses have already started to give the cold shoulder to self-storage operators.\n",
      "In light of these restrictive regulations, innovative business owners have found ways to take advantage of grey areas. Portable storage box companies are now emerging in Hong Kong. These companies collect items from the customer’s doorstep, store them in the warehouse, and deliver the items on demand. This business model is budding in a bid to fill up the market space left vacant by traditional storage companies.\n",
      "Due to the unclear implementation of the new guidelines, landlords of warehouses have already started to give the cold shoulder to self-storage operators\n",
      "These portable storage box companies are running a warehouse similar to those of self-storage operators. The main difference is that customers of the storage box companies never visit the warehouse. By categorising as a portable storage box business, these operators are not subject to the regulations imposed on self-storage firms.\n",
      "The government needs to revisit the new guidelines, which are creating an unlevelled playing field in the storage industry. While the safety of emergency workers and business operators is imperative, the demand for storage space in Hong Kong needs to be met.\n",

      "\n",
      "Oliver Lai’s work experience spans 20 years in real estate, media, marketing and other related industries. He has worked for many well-known companies such as Taipei 101 and Blockbuster BEI, among others. Since 2007, he has served as head of sales and marketing for Parkview Group, where he oversees Parkview Green Beijing as well as the group’s other projects in Nanjing and Huizhou.\n",
      "Born in Taiwan, Lai earned an MBA from Royal Roads University, British Columbia, Canada.\n",
      "Can you explain your strategy for tenant mix? How do you choose brands?\n",
      "We don’t define our shopping sector as “luxury”, “upscale” or “fast fashion”. Our primary goal is to expose visitors to a unique lifestyle. For example, you can spend just 18 yuan [US$2.60] here to enjoy a bowl of Taiwanese noodles, which is not so common in Beijing. Cinemas and supermarkets can only afford much lower rent but we still invite them because they are about lifestyle and can attract the right customers who bring business to other tenants.\n",
      "When we developed the project [around 2010-12], we allocated 30 per cent of the space for dining. At that time, it was ridiculed – shopping malls in downtown Beijing back then typically allocated only 10 to 15 per cent to restaurants [because they can’t afford the high rents paid by luxury brands]. Today, [our approach] has been proven right and we still have 30 per cent for dining.\n",
      "We have a motto “Always fresh”. We basically change 20 to 25 brands per year, which is extraordinarily high by international standards. This is because competition here is intense. E-commerce is prevalent. Consumers in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen learn really fast and are much more willing to try new things. It forced us to think more often what brands are particularly appealing to our target consumers.\n",
      "We have a very lean strategic operation team – six to seven people for the mall part and eight for the office part – but they are from very diverse nations. They studied what brands fit Parkview Green and then went knock on the doors of those brands. We introduced Tesla in this way, for example.\n",
      "Many visitors say Parkview Green has very good taste and that it attracts independent-minded people. Do you think it is hard to replicate?\n",
      "Every city has its own character. In this way, you can’t replicate Parkview Green Beijing in other cities. But beyond personality, there are commonalities. The DNA of Parkview – art, green and the building complex – can be duplicated. We keep the three fundamentals and fine-tune the specifics based on individual markets and local consumers.\n",
      "We have not stopped examining and negotiating new projects around China. Construction has begun on a project in Huizhou, Guangdong, that integrates a hotel and a gallery.\n",
      "How is your office business performing?\n",
      "Our 87,000 sq metres of office space is now 98.8 per cent occupied and is home to big tenants including publishing giant Hearst Corp and law firm Dentons. Our efforts to make tenants feel they always work in a refreshing environment are reflected in many details. For example, all outside deliveries are concentrated on our second underground floor and then delivered [to the recipients] by our internal staff. We deliver free barrelled water to our tenants. The office part is also under the first revamp since opening, just to make sure tenants have a new experience. The average rent now is about 550 yuan per square metre per month, which is among the highest in Beijing.\n",
      "As a Taiwanese who has worked in Beijing for 10 years, what are your feelings about the city? Any frustrations?\n",
      "The pace of social evolution in Beijing is the fastest I have ever seen in the world. I have seen much fewer cases of spitting, littering and horn blowing on the street, especially in the past five years. This is also a highly international city where you have to compete not only with Chinese, but with talent from around the world.\n",
      "To be honest, the thing that vexed me the most is having to teach my employees how to give “service”. This is not the case in Shanghai where there is a long tradition of serving other people. I have to constantly teach my employees how to offer international standards of service.\n",
      "Feed 14: No sign of easing in capital controls even as China’s overseas shopping spree continues, experts say \n",
      "\n",
      "Beijing shows no signs of loosening its capital controls on overseas investments even as more Chinese firms pour into the European and American real estate markets.\n",
      "“I don’t see any relaxation of policies. They’re still very strict,” said Paul Guan, a partner with global law firm Paul Hastings, which specialises in advising Chinese institutional investors on outbound real estate investments.\n",
      "The firm recently represented China Minsheng Investment Group’s property arm SRE Group, a Shanghai-based developer listed in Hong Kong, in its US$88 million acquisition of 75 Howard, a harbourfront condominium development in downtown San Francisco. The deal was completed last week and is the developer’s first project in North America.\n",
      "China has been implementing tough measures to restrict outbound investments in the face of accelerating capital outflows since late last year. The measures include banning overseas investments of more than US$10 billion, forbidding mergers and acquisitions worth more than US$1 billion that are outside a Chinese investor’s core business and halting foreign real estate deals by state-owned enterprises involving more than US$1 billion.\n",
      "China’s foreign investment ‘shopping spree’ over as Beijing moves to slash capital outflow\n",
      "But headline-grabbing cross-border deals have continued regardless.\n",
      "In March, Chongqing-based CC Land Holdings agreed to buy the Leadenhall Building in London, the Square Mile’s tallest tower known as the “Cheesegrater”, for £1.14 billion (US$1.5 billion). The deal marks the largest-ever Chinese purchase of British real estate.\n",
      "In the same month, Beijing Capital Development Holding (Group) made its third British investment, buying Free Place House, a London grade A office building, for £96.5 million.\n",
      "Mainland Chinese and Hong Kong investors were the biggest buyers of commercial properties in the City of London in the first quarter of 2017, according to Savills.\n",
      "I don’t see any relaxation of policies. They’re still very strict\n",
      "Paul Guan, partner, Paul Hastings\n",
      "But these transactions were not an indication that Beijing’s capital controls had been loosened, said Darren Xia, head of international capital group at JLL China.\n",
      "“The restrictions are still in place”, meaning those that could still shop overseas had a listed arm in Hong Kong or branches outside mainland China so they could use overseas proceeds or financing to fund the deals, he said.\n",
      "Xia said that even though many companies still maintained their overseas expansion strategy, they were keeping a “low profile” because it was a very sensitive topic at the moment.\n",
      "The policies were unlikely to be eased before China’s 19th National Congress this autumn, when the new leadership of the Communist Party would be elected, he added.\n",
      "Nevertheless, Chinese investors’ demand for offshore real estate assets remains strong on the expectations that the yuan will continue to depreciate and amid skyrocketing property prices at home.\n",
      "Chinese property investors still getting overseas deals done despite tighter capital controls, says ING\n",
      "Fujian developer Yuzhou Properties said over the weekend that it was actively seeking investment opportunities in Hong Kong and foreign countries to cater to the growing needs of wealthy mainland Chinese buying properties overseas.\n",
      "Despite increased government scrutiny, Chinese outbound real estate transactions soared 84 per cent in the first quarter of 2017 to US$7.5 billion from a year earlier, a report by JLL showed. But on a quarter-on-quarter basis, values were down 36 per cent, signalling an easing in demand amid the curbs.\n",
      "The report also said cross-border buyers were keen on office assets in the core central business district, retail malls and properties in niche sectors such as senior housing.\n",
      "Analysts added that an emerging trend in property investment was to target countries along President Xi Jinping’s “Belt and Road Initiative” such as Malaysia, India and Cambodia, a strategy that would receive policy support, making it easier to transfer capital overseas.\n",
      "Yet the recent activity was the tip of the iceberg in terms of demand as most overseas acquisitions by Chinese companies had stalled due to difficulties in bringing money out of the country this year, even when the amount was far below US$1 billion, Guan said.\n",

      "Quarry Bay is quickly becoming Hong Kong’s new hip business district, as mainland companies take over Central, and foreign firms leave in their droves.\n",
      "As mainlanders continue to swoop on trophy buildings in Central, foreign multinationals are relocating to the east of Hong Kong Island, and this “decentralisation” has been the prominent trend in the office market, say leading property agents.\n",
      "The latest findings from real estate services firm JLL show the total number of new lettings in Central is down 47 per cent month-on-month, with rents edging up 0.5 per cent month-on-month from February to March.\n",
      "Property developer Swire is the biggest landlord in Quarry Bay, and recently reported it has seen bumper numbers of high-profile tenants setting up offices in the area, having closed their Central offices.\n",
      "Among those new tenants are financial services companies Prudential, FWD Insurance and AllianceBernstein, and three leading international law firms.\n",
      "Swire also says luxury brands such as Burberry and Gucci are also moving into its flagship development in the area, Taikoo Place, from Causeway Bay.\n",
      "This whole theme of decentralisation in Hong Kong will continue, and kind of follows what other financial centres in the world have experienced\n",
      "Don Taylor, director, Swire Properties\n",
      "Don Taylor, a director at Swire Properties, said: “This whole theme of decentralisation in Hong Kong will continue, and kind of follows what other financial centres in the world have experienced.”\n",
      "He said occupancy in Taikoo Place office development, for instance, is currently as high as 99 per cent, with rents there ranging between HK$40 and HK$50 per square foot. Rents in its flagship tower, One Island East, are slightly higher at HK$50 and HK$70 per sq ft.\n",
      "But rent rises are still relatively flat compared with other areas, standing around 10 per cent higher than three years ago. Taylor’s clients tell him, too, that in general rental costs account for 10 per cent of total operation costs.\n",
      "He now compares the growing appeal of eastern Hong Kong Island to that of Canary Wharf, the business district in east London which started developing some 20 years ago and which is now hugely popular, adding that the biggest challenge for both is changing people’s perception.\n",
      "Swire has already invested some HK$15 billion redeveloping Taiko Place since July last year. Two triple Grade-A office towers are also currently being built there, each spanning a total gross floor area of 1 million sq ft in addition to 69,000 sq ft of open landscaped gardens. The two towers are expected to be completed next year and 2021, respectively.\n",
      "“We are not just developing office buildings in isolation. It’s all about providing the necessary amenities to give companies confidence that if they relocate to a place like Taikoo Place they will still be able to attract and retain the best talent for their organisations,” said Taylor.\n",
      "“Rental levels are in line with what we offer at One Island East. We have a lot of active negotiations going on at the moment,” he added.\n",
      "In comparison with the new CBD being developed in Kowloon East, Taylor said Island East has the distinct advantage of being on the island, important still for the image of many organisations, and in an area where connectivity will be enhanced with the completion of the Central-Wanchai bypass.\n",

      "\n",
      "Hong Kong’s property developers will face tougher restrictions on the amount of money they can borrow from banks under new measures to be introduced next month in a bid to protect lenders from risk.\n",
      "From June 1, all banks will be required to lower their caps on the amount they lend to developers for construction financing, according to a circular issued by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the city’s de facto central bank, on Friday.\n",
      "The HKMA says it is concerned about the risk the city’s banks are exposing themselves to by lending large amounts to homebuilders, some of whom have been funding their land purchases entirely through borrowing.\n",
      "The extension of construction financing to property developers may expose banks to a substantially higher level of credit and moral hazard risk\n",
      "HKMA circular\n",
      "Under the new measures, the maximum limit on bank loans used by the developer to buy a plot of land will be cut to 40 per cent of the value of the site, down from 50 per cent now.\n",
      "The cap on loans for the construction costs will come down to 80 per cent from the current level of 100 per cent. And the overall cap on bank financing for the whole project will be reduced to 50 per cent of the expected value of the completed properties, from the 60 per cent at the moment.\n",
      "Analysts said the move will increase homebuilders’ overall development costs and particularly hit those who rely heavily on financing for their projects.\n",
      "The new, stricter regulations are designed to “enhance risk management measures on banks,” according to Arthur Yuen, deputy chief executive of the HKMA.\n",
      "The HKMA hopes that by cutting the amount of financing available to the homebuilder it will discourage the developers from offering generous mortgages to buyers – something seen by most observers as hindering efforts to deflate Hong Kong’s sizzling property market.\n",
      "However, Yuen said the new measures are “not intended to cool down the property market.”\n",
      "The authority collected data on the mortgages offered by 13 developers and found some were offering home loans of between 90 per cent and 120 per cent of the value of the properties.\n",
      "These developers had offered a total HK$27.6 billion worth of mortgage loans as of the end of last year, up 189 per cent from HK$10.7 billion at the end of 2015.\n",
      "“HKMA observes that it is now common for property developers to offer mortgage financing with high loan-to-value ratios to buyers to promote sales of their property projects,” the authority said in the circular.\n",
      "These high loan-to-value ratios usually exceed the 70 per cent cap on banks’ mortgage loans because the developers are not regulated by the HKMA and are free to offer these loans.\n",
      "HKMA considers that these loans exceed the “prudential requirements” for banks’ mortgage loans.\n",
      "Moreover, the lending practices of some of the property developers are inconsistent with the prudent lending practices of banks, the HKMA circular said.\n",
      "“In some cases, we understand that borrowers are not required to go through an assessment of their repayment ability,” it said.\n",
      "While the amounts being loaned by developers are still relatively low, the HKMA warned that “it is growing at an increasingly rapid pace.” The authority said banks need to review their risk exposure to housing developers.\n",
      "In addition to limiting the amount loaned, the HKMA will require banks to add 50 per cent more capital weighting on developers who offer total mortgage loans at an amount equal to more than five per cent of their book value.\n",
      "Those offering mortgages valued at equal to or more than 10 per cent of their book value or if they refuse to provide the relevant information, banks would need to double the capital amount to back up the loans they are offering to these developers. This new requirement will start from August 1.\n",
      "Yuen said some developers had reached the 5 per cent threshold while none were currently at the 10 per cent threshold.\n",
      "The new HKMA restrictions come after some property developers involved in recent land acquisitions borrowed heavily to finance their projects.\n",
      "“In a few cases, the amount of the land acquisition cost was financed entirely through borrowing from different authorised institutions [banks]. The extension of construction financing to these property developers may expose banks to a substantially higher level of credit and moral hazard risk.”\n",
      "Hong Kong developers such as Sun Hung Kai Properties (SHKP) and Cheung Kong Property Holdings are among those offering mortgages to homebuyers. Last year, SHKP announced a mortgage offer worth as much as 120 per cent of a home’s value at its project, Park Yoho Venezia, in Yuen Long.\n",
      "Hong Kong’s home price index, which tracks prices in the secondary market, rose for a 12th consecutive month in March, advancing 2.2 per cent to a record 319.8, according to data compiled by the Rating and Valuation Department. On a 12-month basis, home prices rose 17.8 per cent.\n",

      "But as the city’s government prepared to sell what could become the costliest land parcel in the city -- the first grade A commercial land site in downtown Central to go on the market in two decades -- mainland Chinese developers were nowhere to be seen, snared by a tightened remittance process that made it more difficult for capital to flow out of China.\n",
      "“Without mainland buyers aggressively bidding, it will be difficult to achieve some of the eye-popping prices that were being flaunted,” said Denis Ma, head of research at JLL.“This may potentially open the door for local developers, who’ve been adopting a more pragmatic approach toward their bidding strategies, to sweep in and win the site.”\n",

      "The low turnout was “out of our expectations,” said Vincent Cheung Kiu-cho, Colliers International’s deputy managing director for Asia valuation, who had expected between 10 and up to 15 submissions of interest from both local and Chinese developers. “China’s capital control may be one of the reasons as the total investment cost of the site could go up to HK$28 billion including construction cost.”\n",
      "The site could eventually be sold at HK$35,000 per sq ft, comparable with the HK$39,000 per sq ft price fetched by an existing grade A office space at 9 Queen’s Road Central, Ma said.\n",

      "Hong Kong has announced the second set of mortgage-tightening measures in a week to cool a property market that has broken records, taking aim at borrowers with multiple loans and whose income sources come from outside the city in an attempt to reduce banks’ credit risks.\n",
      "Starting immediately, banks must allocate a larger risk weighting toward their assessment of credit worthiness, while cutting the amount of allowable loans on residential and commercial properties, according to a statement by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\n",
      "The move comes as the city’s end-March property prices and transactions surpassed a September 2015 peak by 4.5 per cent, the HKMA said, citing data by the Rating & Valuation Department. The city’s de facto central bank has unveiled eight rounds of tightening measures since 2014.\n",
      "“The long term sustainability of the interest margins on mortgage lending has been under growing pressure,” said the HKMA’s chief executive Norman Chan Tak-lam. That means “less capital can be generated from this line of business, weaking the ability” of banks “to cope with a possible market downturn,” he said.\n",
      "The authorities have focused on using prudential measures such as caps on loans, and adjusting the debt-servicing ratios and stamp duties. Residential mortgage loans totaled HK$1.119 trillion (US$144 billion) at the end of 2016, equivalent to 5 per cent of the banking system’s assets, a level that is considered low by international standards, according to Fitch Ratings.\n",
      "Housing affordability is one of the gravest issues facing Hong Kong’s incoming chief executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, who has pledged to take strong measures to address the issue. The government in November 2015 imposed a 15 per cent stamp duty on second-time borrowers, while the HKMA last week ordered banks to reduce loans to developers.\n",
      "The amount of loans allowed for residential property less than HK$10 million in value will be cut to 50 per cent of their value for borrowers with outstanding mortgages from 60 per cent, while lending to homes exceeding HK$10 million will be cut to 40 per cent from 50 per cent with immediate effect.\n",
      "Companies that are buying homes for corporate use will have their loan amounts cut to 40 per cent of value, from 50 per cent.\n",
      "The measures come a week before two residential complexes with almost 1,800 units are due to be released for sale by Cheung Kong Property Holdings in Tsuen Wan and K&K Property in Kai Tak.\n",
      "“The government wants to send a signal to the market that further actions will be taken to cool the red-hot market,” said Alvin Cheung Chi-wai, associate director at Prudential Brokerage. “The rule has little impact on cash-rich investors who need not borrow too heavily when they buy their second or third homes. But those who cannot afford their first homes will not be hit.”\n",
      "For car parks, commercial or industrial properties, the allowable loans are cut to 30 per cent, from 40 per cent, the HKMA said.\n",
      "A distinction has also been made on borrowers who mostly derive their income from outside Hong Kong, cutting their debt servicing ratio by 10 percentage points to 40 per cent for first-time borrowers, and 30 per cent for borrowers with prior mortgages.\n",
      "For corporate purchases, the ratios are cut by 10 percentage points to a flat 30 per cent for first-time borrowers as well as those with prior mortgages.\n",

      "“While most of the loans are to large developers with good credit ratings and there are strict rules on the types of mortgages banks can offer, what is a concern is the fact that developers also lend via their financing vehicles to individuals who are unable to get mortgages from the banks,” she said. “This was something the HKMA was trying to address with last week’s tightening measures, and these new measures are a continuation of that.”\n",
      "Prospective home buyers are likely to become more cautious and take their time in digesting how the new rules affect them, said Ricacorp Properties in a statement.\n",

      "The so-called “commercial-to-residential” projects, which include various types of units such as studio apartments or even bungalows built on commercial plots, have become widespread in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou, particularly among young and non-local buyers, since 2015 amid skyrocketing home prices in top cities.\n",
      "These types of properties are usually more affordable than pure residential projects as the commercial land acquired by developers is much cheaper than residential land, which is becoming more scarce and expensive in major cities.\n",
      "Owners’ angry protests show why Beijing must tip toe in curbing the property market\n",
      "The biggest advantage of these properties is that they are not subject to home purchase restrictions, meaning anyone, including non-local residents, can buy as many units as they like.\n",

      "Based on that projection, a 10,000 sq ft (929 square meters) office would cost HK$1.4 million (US$180,000) per month to rent, or HK$70 million to own.\n",
      "Mainland Chinese companies, which already occupy an estimated 56 per cent of all new commercial office leases in April, are the most likely tenants that can afford these rents, and will continue to underpin leasing activity in Central, JLL said.\n",
      "“The sale of Murray Road shows the strong demand for Grade A offices in the Central and Admiralty areas,” said the Secretary of Development Eric Ma Siu-cheung. “Despite having a total sale of half a million square meters of gross floor area of commercial and industrial land, the market still has a strong demand for commercial sites.”\n",

      "The successful bid was Henderson’s first in almost two years, as it and other Hong Kong developers had been priced out by aggressive mainland Chinese companies like HNA, which spent HK$27.2 billion over four months to snatch four parcels of land at the former Kai Tak airport.\n",

      "\n",
      "China’s largest property agents have quietly lowered their commission fees amid the worst property downturn since 2010 following unprecedented market cooling measures by government authorities.\n",
      "In Beijing Homelink, China’s largest property agent, is offering rates below its 2.7 per cent commission fee in many cases. 5i5j, the second-largest agent, lowered its official rate from 2.1- 2.2 per cent to 1.9 per cent, according to interviews with individual agents and buyers in the city.\n",
      "However, a 5i5j spokesman told the South China Morning Post that reports its commission fee was lowered company wide from 2.5 to 2 per cent were “totally untrue”. He said commission fees are decided on a case-by-case basis and that specific rates were determined by the “sophistication” of the deals.\n",
      "Homelink declined to comment for this story. But the company told Beijing Youth Daily on Monday that each outlet determines the rate by themselves, and that the company hasn’t cut rates in a unified way. The Daily reported that many Homelink outlets have cut the rate to 2.2 per cent.\n",
      "In reality, the “official” commission rate is the figure agents generally tell prospective buyers, which in many cases deviates from the actual rate. Even in boom times, agents would often lower the rate when homes were also listed by a rival agent and buyers approached the rival, or if the buyers were old customers, or for buyers who could pay in cash without bank loans. However, when a downturn hits agents are more willing to compromise a few basis points in the commission fee for a larger transaction, and buyers gain more bargaining power.\n",
      "A typical home in Beijing now sells for between 6 to 10 million yuan (US$870,000 to US$1.4 million), so even a 0.1 per cent cut means 6,000 to 10,000 yuan [LESS?]commission fee.\n",
      "A prospective buyer surnamed Hua, who bought an apartment through 5i5j a year ago, told the Post that the same agent promised to reduce her fee to 1.75 per cent for full cash payment, or 1.89 per cent if she needed loans. Prior to that, 5i5j agents charged a 2.5 per cent fee but genuine buyers could bargain it down to 2.1-2.2 per cent.\n",
      "Hua said Homelink was much less likely to compromise, but actual rates can be negotiated at 2.5 per cent, but it varies based on different locations, even within the same company.\n",
      "A Homelink agent approached by the Post said he hasn’t received official guidance that the 2.7 per cent fee will be adjusted, but added that he can offer lower rate if buyers are genuine and if the homes are exclusively represented by his outlets. Outlets operated by China’s agents usually exclusively represent a small portion of homes nearby and co-represent a majority of homes among other outlets in the same company.\n",
      "The commission fee adjustment came just a few days after Homelink announced it had closed 87 outlets among the 1,500 or so it operates in Beijing. The city’s housing commission said various agent firms closed 138 outlets recently, and 520 were closed on orders of the government due to violations.\n",
      "Homelink, China’s biggest property agent, closes 87 branches in Beijing as buying curbs bite\n",

      "\n",
      "Driving along Beijing’s Dongdaqiao Road it’s hard to ignore Parkview Green, with its iconic pyramid shape, funky glass wall and imposing sculptures at the entrance.\n",
      "The complex, which houses a shopping mall, boutique hotel and offices, is known in the expat community for its generous collections of artworks (here Salvador Dali’s surreal works hang alongside Yue Minjun’s signature Chinese contemporary art), fine gallery and attractive shops that can be found nowhere else in the mainland.\n",
      "Oliver KH Lai, head of sales and marketing at Parkview Group – a Taiwanese family group – who oversees the company’s mainland projects including Parkview Green in Beijing, insisted there is more to the centre than aesthetic considerations.\n",
      "The economics behind the operation is equally important and his team does care about “profit and loss”, he said in response to concerns that the centre is too ‘arty’ to give any thought to financial performance.\n",
      "Lai said the project’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) had turned positive by the end of last year for the first time since it opened in 2012. As a private company, Parkview does not disclose earnings numbers.\n",
      "“Our team is evaluated by a comprehensive system, just like standard companies are,” Lai said. “There is a ‘key performance indicators’ system that applies to all staff members, and includes occupancy ratio, talent retention ratio, workforce development and so on.”\n",
      "But he also stressed that art and the environment are in the DNA of Parkview and that he, as a professional manager, is driven and evaluated by much more than just financial performance.\n",
      "George Wong, chairman of the Parkview Group and oldest son of the company’s founder, is a passionate art lover and collector, who from the start wanted the project to be his personal “fairy tale” – a genuinely “artistic” and “green” development that raised the bar for the capital’s hospitality industry.\n",
      "That vision, unexpectedly, struck a chord with the city’s well-educated yuppies as well as foreign tourists. According to Parkview Green’s own customer survey, frequent shoppers are mainly in the 25-36 years old bracket, 70 per cent women, and nearly 60 per cent visitors returning from overseas. They tend to be drawn by the Taiwanese cuisine, boutique supermarket and Lumière cinemas.\n",
      "That’s an unexpected bonus, according to Lai, who said Parkview did not specifically target overseas returnees.\n",
      "The same is true for its “green” elements. From the onset Wong wanted Parkview Green to be a green building with high standards of sustainability to prove that China, too, cares about environmental protection and energy efficiency. It managed this so well that it became the first commercial project in China to be awarded LEED Platinum certification. LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) is the most widely used green building rating system in the world.\n",
      "Parkview Green quickly became a haven for locals to escape from Beijing’s choking haze, the building’s ETFE (Ethylene Tetrafluoroethylene) film creating a mini-climate that insulates it from the outside.\n",
      "“We did not do this with an aim to attract visitors. It just did,” said Lai.\n",
      "He said his boss was so committed to his “fairy tale” that in the first year after opening he spent three days a week in Beijing, instilling in Lai a deep knowledge of the Wong family’s background, values and philosophy, as well as ways of doing business, just to make sure he had a general manager that “best suited his ideal”.\n",
      "Asked about profit prospects, Lai said: “It depends on how you calculate the ‘profitability’. Chairman George Wong invested 2.8 billion yuan to build the project and that does not count the 500 or so artworks scattered around the complex. If you count that in, it would be very difficult to recover investment”.\n",
      "Despite the heavy upfront investment – the project was famous for its construction delays and budget overrun before it formally opened five years ago – he expects it to break even in eight to nine years.\n",

Shanghai’s new home sales declined 12.8 per cent in the first week of May from the previous week, according to Centaline data.\n",
      "Last week, Shenzhen became the latest of the big “first-tier cities” in China to clamp down on so-called “commercial flats” – homes built on land meant for office or retail use, previously a very popular alternative to units being sold in purely residential projects. The city’s government banned developers from building bathrooms, pantries, balconies and other residential features in individual units within buildings originally designated for commercial use.\n",
      "Commercial flats are a major loophole in the existing system\n",
      "Zhang Hongwei, chief researcher, Tospur\n",
      "Previously, the Shanghai government demanded that developers undertake not to sell any more apartments on land acquired for office and retail use, and instead to sell the space on a storey by storey basis. The Beijing local authorities not only banned the sale of new commercial flats to individuals, but also existing ones.\n",
      "“Commercial flats are a major loophole in the existing system. Various details hint that the crackdown in Beijing is not alone, but a coordinated effort among the biggest cities, which means other big cities could follow,” said Zhang Hongwei, chief researcher with Shanghai-based property consultant Tospur.\n",
      "“Behind the campaign is an effort to shift the low-end workforce in these cities elsewhere.”\n",
      "Developers brace themselves as Beijing gets tough on flats sold on commercial land\n",
      "Commercial flats as a share of Shenzhen’s new home sales rose to 17.8 per cent in 2016, while inventory by the end of that year reached 860,000 square metres, according to Centaline Property’s Shenzhen unit. In Beijing that ratio is 60 per cent.\n",
      "The loophole-closing campaign has also spread to second-tier cities. Haikou, the capital of tropical Hainan island, last Wednesday included commercial flats and second-hand homes in its purchase restrictions. The city, along with Sanya, another tourist haven on the island, banned new homes from being resold within two years of purchase.\n",
      "Central China metropolis Wuhan capped decoration prices – the amount charged by a developer to decorate an apartment for the new occupant – at 5,000 yuan per square metre for homes sold at 30,000 yuan per sq m or higher. Skirting government-imposed limits on property prices by adding a “decoration fee” had become common practice in major cities.\n",
      "The slew of tightening came after new home sales in April dropped sharply from a feverish March. Contracted sales by 23 top Chinese developers reached a combined 255 billion yuan, down 29 per cent from March, the biggest drop in 15 months. Nationally, residential property sales by floor space slumped 36 per cent year-on-year, while by value they declined 47.8 per cent, according to the Post’s calculation based on National Statistics Bureau data.\n",
      "Pre-owned homes, which dominate sales in first-tier cities, also cooled substantially. Sales of existing homes in Beijing in the first two weeks of May fell 47.4 per cent from the previous two weeks, according to the city’s housing commission.\n",

      "\n",
      "The growing number of “nano flats”, flats with a usable size area under 160 sq ft, is spurring demand for self-storage facilities. However, storage operators have flagged a 30 per cent drop in available space for business in light of tightening warehouse regulations following a fatal fire in June 2016. These new guidelines have created murky waters for self-storage business owners and landlords. While safety is a priority, CBRE urges the government and operators to find a middle ground so that the market demand is not ignored.\n",
      "There are over 800 self-storage locations managed by about 100 operators across town, according to data from the Fire Department. The Fire Department and the Buildings Department sent warning letters to more than one-third of these operators after a fatal fire took place in a warehouse in Kowloon Bay last year. The letters specified new rules for the fit-out of self-storage warehouses.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two most controversial points amongst the new regulations were the requirement for a 2.4-metre corridor between containers, a 1.4 times increase from the existing regulations on warehouses, and a 1:16 window to total floor area ratio.\n",
      "Based on the new guidelines, about one-third of Hong Kong’s available storage space will be slashed, according to Luigi La Tona, executive director of the Self Storage Association Asia. CBRE predicts that the actual reduction would be more than that as small to medium-sized operators that cannot afford the costs associated with refitting their space will be forced to close down. There have already been various cases of self storage businesses folding. The costs incurred by operators to meet these new regulations will also potentially create a surge in storage rental fees.\n",
      "There have already been various cases of self storage businesses folding. The costs incurred by operators to meet these new regulations will also potentially create a surge in storage rental fees\n",
      "Our team at CBRE believe that there are viable solutions that can satisfy the operator and government’s requirements. For example, container doors could be converted into sliding doors so that the corridor space will not be compromised while both doors are open. From our understanding, the Fire Department has increased the corridor dimension from 1 meter to 2.4 meters to create more space for firemen to move between containers in case of an emergency. A sliding door ensures that the firemen’s safety is taken into account without infringing on the self-storage space.\n",
      "Regarding the 1:16 window to total floor area ratio, CBRE urges the government to reconsider the stipulation. The ratio is a regulatory requirement applicable to office and residential buildings for the sake of airflow and hygiene. CBRE does not believe that this ratio is necessary or suitable for the purposes of a warehouse. Since the foot traffic of warehouses is much lower than that of an office or residential building, we suggest the government reconsider this overarching requirement and judge each storage company on a case-by-case basis.\n",
      "Due to the unclear implementation of the new guidelines, landlords of warehouses have already started to give the cold shoulder to self-storage operators.\n",
      "In light of these restrictive regulations, innovative business owners have found ways to take advantage of grey areas. Portable storage box companies are now emerging in Hong Kong. These companies collect items from the customer’s doorstep, store them in the warehouse, and deliver the items on demand. This business model is budding in a bid to fill up the market space left vacant by traditional storage companies.\n",
      "Due to the unclear implementation of the new guidelines, landlords of warehouses have already started to give the cold shoulder to self-storage operators\n",
      "These portable storage box companies are running a warehouse similar to those of self-storage operators. The main difference is that customers of the storage box companies never visit the warehouse. By categorising as a portable storage box business, these operators are not subject to the regulations imposed on self-storage firms.\n",
      "The government needs to revisit the new guidelines, which are creating an unlevelled playing field in the storage industry. While the safety of emergency workers and business operators is imperative, the demand for storage space in Hong Kong needs to be met.\n",

      "Can you explain your strategy for tenant mix? How do you choose brands?\n",
      "We don’t define our shopping sector as “luxury”, “upscale” or “fast fashion”. Our primary goal is to expose visitors to a unique lifestyle. For example, you can spend just 18 yuan [US$2.60] here to enjoy a bowl of Taiwanese noodles, which is not so common in Beijing. Cinemas and supermarkets can only afford much lower rent but we still invite them because they are about lifestyle and can attract the right customers who bring business to other tenants.\n",
      "When we developed the project [around 2010-12], we allocated 30 per cent of the space for dining. At that time, it was ridiculed – shopping malls in downtown Beijing back then typically allocated only 10 to 15 per cent to restaurants [because they can’t afford the high rents paid by luxury brands]. Today, [our approach] has been proven right and we still have 30 per cent for dining.\n",
      "We have a motto “Always fresh”. We basically change 20 to 25 brands per year, which is extraordinarily high by international standards. This is because competition here is intense. E-commerce is prevalent. Consumers in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen learn really fast and are much more willing to try new things. It forced us to think more often what brands are particularly appealing to our target consumers.\n",
      "We have a very lean strategic operation team – six to seven people for the mall part and eight for the office part – but they are from very diverse nations. They studied what brands fit Parkview Green and then went knock on the doors of those brands. We introduced Tesla in this way, for example.\n",

      "Every city has its own character. In this way, you can’t replicate Parkview Green Beijing in other cities. But beyond personality, there are commonalities. The DNA of Parkview – art, green and the building complex – can be duplicated. We keep the three fundamentals and fine-tune the specifics based on individual markets and local consumers.\n",
      "We have not stopped examining and negotiating new projects around China. Construction has begun on a project in Huizhou, Guangdong, that integrates a hotel and a gallery.\n",
      "How is your office business performing?\n",
      "Our 87,000 sq metres of office space is now 98.8 per cent occupied and is home to big tenants including publishing giant Hearst Corp and law firm Dentons. Our efforts to make tenants feel they always work in a refreshing environment are reflected in many details. For example, all outside deliveries are concentrated on our second underground floor and then delivered [to the recipients] by our internal staff. We deliver free barrelled water to our tenants. The office part is also under the first revamp since opening, just to make sure tenants have a new experience. The average rent now is about 550 yuan per square metre per month, which is among the highest in Beijing.\n",
      "As a Taiwanese who has worked in Beijing for 10 years, what are your feelings about the city? Any frustrations?\n",
      "The pace of social evolution in Beijing is the fastest I have ever seen in the world. I have seen much fewer cases of spitting, littering and horn blowing on the street, especially in the past five years. This is also a highly international city where you have to compete not only with Chinese, but with talent from around the world.\n",
      "To be honest, the thing that vexed me the most is having to teach my employees how to give “service”. This is not the case in Shanghai where there is a long tradition of serving other people. I have to constantly teach my employees how to offer international standards of service.\n",
      "Feed 14: No sign of easing in capital controls even as China’s overseas shopping spree continues, experts say \n",
      "\n",
      "Beijing shows no signs of loosening its capital controls on overseas investments even as more Chinese firms pour into the European and American real estate markets.\n",
      "“I don’t see any relaxation of policies. They’re still very strict,” said Paul Guan, a partner with global law firm Paul Hastings, which specialises in advising Chinese institutional investors on outbound real estate investments.\n",
      "The firm recently represented China Minsheng Investment Group’s property arm SRE Group, a Shanghai-based developer listed in Hong Kong, in its US$88 million acquisition of 75 Howard, a harbourfront condominium development in downtown San Francisco. The deal was completed last week and is the developer’s first project in North America.\n",
      "China has been implementing tough measures to restrict outbound investments in the face of accelerating capital outflows since late last year. The measures include banning overseas investments of more than US$10 billion, forbidding mergers and acquisitions worth more than US$1 billion that are outside a Chinese investor’s core business and halting foreign real estate deals by state-owned enterprises involving more than US$1 billion.\n",
      "China’s foreign investment ‘shopping spree’ over as Beijing moves to slash capital outflow\n",
      "But headline-grabbing cross-border deals have continued regardless.\n",
      "In March, Chongqing-based CC Land Holdings agreed to buy the Leadenhall Building in London, the Square Mile’s tallest tower known as the “Cheesegrater”, for £1.14 billion (US$1.5 billion). The deal marks the largest-ever Chinese purchase of British real estate.\n",
      "In the same month, Beijing Capital Development Holding (Group) made its third British investment, buying Free Place House, a London grade A office building, for £96.5 million.\n",
      "Mainland Chinese and Hong Kong investors were the biggest buyers of commercial properties in the City of London in the first quarter of 2017, according to Savills.\n",
      "I don’t see any relaxation of policies. They’re still very strict\n",
      "Paul Guan, partner, Paul Hastings\n",
      "But these transactions were not an indication that Beijing’s capital controls had been loosened, said Darren Xia, head of international capital group at JLL China.\n",
      "“The restrictions are still in place”, meaning those that could still shop overseas had a listed arm in Hong Kong or branches outside mainland China so they could use overseas proceeds or financing to fund the deals, he said.\n",
      "Xia said that even though many companies still maintained their overseas expansion strategy, they were keeping a “low profile” because it was a very sensitive topic at the moment.\n",
      "The policies were unlikely to be eased before China’s 19th National Congress this autumn, when the new leadership of the Communist Party would be elected, he added.\n",
      "Nevertheless, Chinese investors’ demand for offshore real estate assets remains strong on the expectations that the yuan will continue to depreciate and amid skyrocketing property prices at home.\n",
      "Chinese property investors still getting overseas deals done despite tighter capital controls, says ING\n",
      "Fujian developer Yuzhou Properties said over the weekend that it was actively seeking investment opportunities in Hong Kong and foreign countries to cater to the growing needs of wealthy mainland Chinese buying properties overseas.\n",
      "Despite increased government scrutiny, Chinese outbound real estate transactions soared 84 per cent in the first quarter of 2017 to US$7.5 billion from a year earlier, a report by JLL showed. But on a quarter-on-quarter basis, values were down 36 per cent, signalling an easing in demand amid the curbs.\n",
      "The report also said cross-border buyers were keen on office assets in the core central business district, retail malls and properties in niche sectors such as senior housing.\n",
      "Analysts added that an emerging trend in property investment was to target countries along President Xi Jinping’s “Belt and Road Initiative” such as Malaysia, India and Cambodia, a strategy that would receive policy support, making it easier to transfer capital overseas.\n",
      "Yet the recent activity was the tip of the iceberg in terms of demand as most overseas acquisitions by Chinese companies had stalled due to difficulties in bringing money out of the country this year, even when the amount was far below US$1 billion, Guan said.\n",

      "\n",
      "Quarry Bay is quickly becoming Hong Kong’s new hip business district, as mainland companies take over Central, and foreign firms leave in their droves.\n",
      "As mainlanders continue to swoop on trophy buildings in Central, foreign multinationals are relocating to the east of Hong Kong Island, and this “decentralisation” has been the prominent trend in the office market, say leading property agents.\n",
      "The latest findings from real estate services firm JLL show the total number of new lettings in Central is down 47 per cent month-on-month, with rents edging up 0.5 per cent month-on-month from February to March.\n",
      "Property developer Swire is the biggest landlord in Quarry Bay, and recently reported it has seen bumper numbers of high-profile tenants setting up offices in the area, having closed their Central offices.\n",
      "Among those new tenants are financial services companies Prudential, FWD Insurance and AllianceBernstein, and three leading international law firms.\n",
      "Swire also says luxury brands such as Burberry and Gucci are also moving into its flagship development in the area, Taikoo Place, from Causeway Bay.\n",
      "This whole theme of decentralisation in Hong Kong will continue, and kind of follows what other financial centres in the world have experienced\n",
      "Don Taylor, director, Swire Properties\n",
      "Don Taylor, a director at Swire Properties, said: “This whole theme of decentralisation in Hong Kong will continue, and kind of follows what other financial centres in the world have experienced.”\n",
      "He said occupancy in Taikoo Place office development, for instance, is currently as high as 99 per cent, with rents there ranging between HK$40 and HK$50 per square foot. Rents in its flagship tower, One Island East, are slightly higher at HK$50 and HK$70 per sq ft.\n",
      "But rent rises are still relatively flat compared with other areas, standing around 10 per cent higher than three years ago. Taylor’s clients tell him, too, that in general rental costs account for 10 per cent of total operation costs.\n",
      "He now compares the growing appeal of eastern Hong Kong Island to that of Canary Wharf, the business district in east London which started developing some 20 years ago and which is now hugely popular, adding that the biggest challenge for both is changing people’s perception.\n",
      "Swire has already invested some HK$15 billion redeveloping Taiko Place since July last year. Two triple Grade-A office towers are also currently being built there, each spanning a total gross floor area of 1 million sq ft in addition to 69,000 sq ft of open landscaped gardens. The two towers are expected to be completed next year and 2021, respectively.\n",
      "“We are not just developing office buildings in isolation. It’s all about providing the necessary amenities to give companies confidence that if they relocate to a place like Taikoo Place they will still be able to attract and retain the best talent for their organisations,” said Taylor.\n",
      "“Rental levels are in line with what we offer at One Island East. We have a lot of active negotiations going on at the moment,” he added.\n",
      "In comparison with the new CBD being developed in Kowloon East, Taylor said Island East has the distinct advantage of being on the island, important still for the image of many organisations, and in an area where connectivity will be enhanced with the completion of the Central-Wanchai bypass.\n",
      "Feed 16: Hong Kong homebuilders to face tougher limits on bank borrowing \n",
      "\n",
      "Hong Kong’s property developers will face tougher restrictions on the amount of money they can borrow from banks under new measures to be introduced next month in a bid to protect lenders from risk.\n",
      "From June 1, all banks will be required to lower their caps on the amount they lend to developers for construction financing, according to a circular issued by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the city’s de facto central bank, on Friday.\n",
      "The HKMA says it is concerned about the risk the city’s banks are exposing themselves to by lending large amounts to homebuilders, some of whom have been funding their land purchases entirely through borrowing.\n",
      "The extension of construction financing to property developers may expose banks to a substantially higher level of credit and moral hazard risk\n",
      "HKMA circular\n",
      "Under the new measures, the maximum limit on bank loans used by the developer to buy a plot of land will be cut to 40 per cent of the value of the site, down from 50 per cent now.\n",
      "The cap on loans for the construction costs will come down to 80 per cent from the current level of 100 per cent. And the overall cap on bank financing for the whole project will be reduced to 50 per cent of the expected value of the completed properties, from the 60 per cent at the moment.\n",
      "Analysts said the move will increase homebuilders’ overall development costs and particularly hit those who rely heavily on financing for their projects.\n",
      "The new, stricter regulations are designed to “enhance risk management measures on banks,” according to Arthur Yuen, deputy chief executive of the HKMA.\n",
      "The HKMA hopes that by cutting the amount of financing available to the homebuilder it will discourage the developers from offering generous mortgages to buyers – something seen by most observers as hindering efforts to deflate Hong Kong’s sizzling property market.\n",
      "However, Yuen said the new measures are “not intended to cool down the property market.”\n",
      "The authority collected data on the mortgages offered by 13 developers and found some were offering home loans of between 90 per cent and 120 per cent of the value of the properties.\n",
      "These developers had offered a total HK$27.6 billion worth of mortgage loans as of the end of last year, up 189 per cent from HK$10.7 billion at the end of 2015.\n",
      "“HKMA observes that it is now common for property developers to offer mortgage financing with high loan-to-value ratios to buyers to promote sales of their property projects,” the authority said in the circular.\n",
      "These high loan-to-value ratios usually exceed the 70 per cent cap on banks’ mortgage loans because the developers are not regulated by the HKMA and are free to offer these loans.\n",
      "HKMA considers that these loans exceed the “prudential requirements” for banks’ mortgage loans.\n",
      "Moreover, the lending practices of some of the property developers are inconsistent with the prudent lending practices of banks, the HKMA circular said.\n",
      "“In some cases, we understand that borrowers are not required to go through an assessment of their repayment ability,” it said.\n",
      "While the amounts being loaned by developers are still relatively low, the HKMA warned that “it is growing at an increasingly rapid pace.” The authority said banks need to review their risk exposure to housing developers.\n",
      "In addition to limiting the amount loaned, the HKMA will require banks to add 50 per cent more capital weighting on developers who offer total mortgage loans at an amount equal to more than five per cent of their book value.\n",
      "Those offering mortgages valued at equal to or more than 10 per cent of their book value or if they refuse to provide the relevant information, banks would need to double the capital amount to back up the loans they are offering to these developers. This new requirement will start from August 1.\n",
      "Yuen said some developers had reached the 5 per cent threshold while none were currently at the 10 per cent threshold.\n",
      "The new HKMA restrictions come after some property developers involved in recent land acquisitions borrowed heavily to finance their projects.\n",
      "“In a few cases, the amount of the land acquisition cost was financed entirely through borrowing from different authorised institutions [banks]. The extension of construction financing to these property developers may expose banks to a substantially higher level of credit and moral hazard risk.”\n",
      "Hong Kong developers such as Sun Hung Kai Properties (SHKP) and Cheung Kong Property Holdings are among those offering mortgages to homebuyers. Last year, SHKP announced a mortgage offer worth as much as 120 per cent of a home’s value at its project, Park Yoho Venezia, in Yuen Long.\n",
      "Hong Kong’s home price index, which tracks prices in the secondary market, rose for a 12th consecutive month in March, advancing 2.2 per cent to a record 319.8, according to data compiled by the Rating and Valuation Department. On a 12-month basis, home prices rose 17.8 per cent.\n",

      "\n",
      "Mainland Chinese buyers had been setting one price record after another as they snapped up Hong Kong’s commercial land and residential property for the past year.\n",
      "But as the city’s government prepared to sell what could become the costliest land parcel in the city -- the first grade A commercial land site in downtown Central to go on the market in two decades -- mainland Chinese developers were nowhere to be seen, snared by a tightened remittance process that made it more difficult for capital to flow out of China.\n",
      "“Without mainland buyers aggressively bidding, it will be difficult to achieve some of the eye-popping prices that were being flaunted,” said Denis Ma, head of research at JLL.“This may potentially open the door for local developers, who’ve been adopting a more pragmatic approach toward their bidding strategies, to sweep in and win the site.”\n",
      "Nine bids were received on Friday noon when the tender closed on the Murray Road site in Central, where a five-storey public car park now stands, according to the Lands Department.\n",
      "Bids were received from Sun Hung Kai Properties, Nan Fung Development, Henderson Land Development Co., Cheung Kong Property (Holdings), Wheelock & Co., Chinese Estates Holdings  and an unidentified party.\n",
      "Among Chinese developers, bids were received from Shimao Property Holdings of tycoon Hui Wing Mau (許榮茂), as well as Chongqing-based CC Land Holdings. Both companies are listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.\n",
      "The site, which can be developed into a 30-storey grade A office building with 450,996 square feet of gross floor area, or 16,000 sq ft per floor, is valued at between HK$15.7 billion to as much as HK$22 billion (US$2.82 billion), or HK$35,000 to HK$48,000 per sq ft, according to surveyors.\n",
      "The market had been expecting cash-rich companies such as the Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), the HNA Group and major insurers to be among bidders for the Murray Road parcel.\n",
      "Several of them had made inquiries about the site over the past year, agents said.\n",
      "The low turnout was “out of our expectations,” said Vincent Cheung Kiu-cho, Colliers International’s deputy managing director for Asia valuation, who had expected between 10 and up to 15 submissions of interest from both local and Chinese developers. “China’s capital control may be one of the reasons as the total investment cost of the site could go up to HK$28 billion including construction cost.”\n",
      "The site could eventually be sold at HK$35,000 per sq ft, comparable with the HK$39,000 per sq ft price fetched by an existing grade A office space at 9 Queen’s Road Central, Ma said.\n",
      "“The market is over optimistic the office market,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The winning developer will be required to include a public car park in its building plan that can accommodate 102 parking lots for private cars and 69 lots for motorcycles, according to the Murray Road site tender document.\n",
      "A warmer reception may await at another tender at the former Kai Tak airport site, where Area 1K Site 1 is up for sale.\n",
      "The land parcel, estimated to fetch between HK$6.3 billion and HK$7.48 billion, has drawn bids from 16 developers. They include Sun Hung Kai, China Resources Land, Chinachem, China Overseas Land & Investment, K. Wah International, Vanke Property (Overseas). Other bidders including a joint venture between Emperor International and Grand Ming Group Holdings .  The winning bid for both parcels will be announced next week.\n",

      "The company belonging to Jared Kushner’s family is pulling out of a presentation to investors in China following criticism that his sister invoked his work for his father-in-law, President Donald Trump, in a similar pitch last weekend.\n",
      "James Yolles, a Kushner Co spokesman, said Thursday that no employee will appear at the presentation in Shenzhen on Saturday. He declined to say whether a third party would promote the project on its behalf.\n",
      "Kushner’s sister, Nicole Meyer, sought as much as US$150 million in Beijing and Shanghai last weekend for a proposed real-estate development in Jersey City, New Jersey, telling prospective investors that buying in could help them win residency visas. During the presentation, she mentioned her brother’s White House role and, at one point, showed a photograph of the president.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kushner Co apologised, saying the mention wasn’t intended to lure investors, merely to note that her brother had moved into government. Jared Kushner has divested ownership in many projects to close relatives, and has vowed to avoid discussions on renewing the visa programme his sister touted.\n",
      "That programme is known as EB-5 and allows foreigners to obtain visas by investing at least US$500,000 in a project promising to create jobs. The day before the presentation, Trump, who ran on a promise to curb immigration, extended the programme when he signed a budget bill.\n",
      "How the Kushner family’s ‘golden visa’ pitch in China cast doubt on Trump’s tough immigration stance\n",
      "Senator Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, criticised Meyer in a Thursday letter to the Department of Homeland Security. Grassley this year introduced bipartisan legislation to end the EB-5 programme.\n",
      "One Journal Square, the project for which Kushner Co is seeking investment, has faced political opposition in its host city, where it wants public financing. WeWork, a co-working office start-up, was originally going to be a tenant. It later decided against the arrangement and is also expected to sell its stake in the project.\n",

      "The investment comes as a rising number of Hong Kong-listed companies are snapping up properties in London amid investment yields that have been compressed by soaring asset prices in Hong Kong.\n",
      "Kwok Family Interests and Ballymore, the 35-year old Irish developer, have formed a 50-50 partnership and plan to build an 804-unit residential project called Goodluck Hope on a 2.7 hectare site. Due for completion in 2020, it will also provide 21,528 square feet of commercial space.\n",
      "\n",
      "The joint plan was first submitted in January 2015 and approved by the London Borough of Tower Hamlets in September 2016, according to a statement provided to the South China Morning Post.\n",
      "Thomas Lam Ho-man, senior director at property consultancy Knight Frank, said investors are flocking to London because the entry level is now too high in Hong Kong.\n",
      "“Prime properties in Hong Kong are much more costly than London where they achieve a better yield. More importantly, the British pound lost at least 20 per cent and will make property more affordable for Hong Kong investors,” he said.\n",
      "Lam believes more investors from Hong Kong and the mainland will continue their buying spree once the country’s economic prospect become clearer after Brexit.\n",
